# WorldsMerger
A tool for the possibility of mapping players' inventories for transferring between worlds with different seeds and items IDs (tested on 1.7.10).

Perhaps you have ever had the desire to move to another server on the modpack?  
But, even if you have world saves, you can not just move the playerdata to another save, because in 1.7.10 items have a numeric ID, which is generated relative to the world seed.  
This project allow to map id of everything inside your playerdata to another world' ids.  
Everything what you need is a old world `level.dat`, old world playerdata file and a new world `level.dat`.
